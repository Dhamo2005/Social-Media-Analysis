**Goal:**  
Understand how people engage with social media posts over time (likes, comments, shares).

**Steps:**  
1. **Collect:** Grab post data (when posted, likes, etc.) from platforms like X.  
2. **Sort:** Use Python (Pandas) to clean and organize the data, SQL if needed.  
3. **Check:** See how engagement changes daily or weekly.  
4. **Graph:** Draw a line graph with Matplotlib to show trends.

**Result:**  
A clear graph showing when engagement peaks (e.g., more likes on Fridays).

**Tools:**  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- SQL
